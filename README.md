## Training
1. Change the file paths to the download datasets above in list/ucf-train.list and list/ucf-test.list
2. Feel free to change the hyperparameters in option.py
3. Train AT and FT modules respectively by changing the parameters in the dataset file and the module in the train file.
4. run python main.py

## Testing
1. run python late_fusion.py

### Due to the large size of video features, we will upload video features and all ckpt models that have been run.
